Originally, ECW was known as Eastern Championship Wrestling when it was a member of the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), an organization that had numerous member promotions. ECW withdrew as a member of the NWA in 1994 and renamed itself to Extreme Championship Wrestling.[1] The championship remained active until April 2001, when ECW filed for bankruptcy. All of ECW's assets were later purchased by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) in mid-2003, including the copyrights to ECW's championships. In May 2006, WWE extended its promotion by adding ECW as a third additional brand, the others being Raw and SmackDown!, in a storyline sports extension.[3] The ECW World Heavyweight Championship was the only former ECW championship reactivated by WWE for the new brand.[4] However, the title history was published by WWE on its website. Title reigns were determined either by professional wrestling matches with different tag teams (a duo of wrestlers) or stables (a group of more than two wrestlers) using ring names, involved in pre-existing scripted feuds or were awarded the title due to scripted circumstances; the championship could have also been vacated by the promotion. Wrestlers were portrayed as either villains or heroes as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches for the championship.","44 wrestlers have ever been ECW World Tag Team Champion. Johnny Grunge, Rocco Rock, and Kronus are tied for the highest number of wins (4). However, Johnny Grunge and Rocco Rock have the same, higher number of combined days as Champion at 369 each.","i found a table of List of ECW World Tag Team Champions.

Belgium, Estonia & The French Navy also lost ships to this submarine.","I found a table listing which ships the German submarine U-9 attacked during the Second World War. Between 1940 and 1944 10 ships were attacked by the submarine with the latest one being a Soviet Union ship called Shtorm.","The German submarine U-9 attacked ten ships sinking The Flandria, The Patria, the Linda, The San Tiburcio, The Doris, The Tringa, The Viiu, and the Sigurd Faulbaum.It only damaged the Shtorm. And when it attempting to attack the ORP Błyskawica it misfired so there was no damage.","The German U-9 Submarine was a type IIB of submarines from Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine. Germaniawerft placed its keel on February 8, 1935 in Kiel as courtyard number 543. It was launched on July 30, 1935 and commissioned on August 21, with Korvettenkapitän Hans-Günther Looff in command.The U-9 conducted 19 patrols under a series of commanders, including the ace of the Wolfgang Lüth submarine, sinking eight ships for a total of 17,221 tons of gross log (TRB) and damaging another 412 tons displaced. This included the French coastal submarine of Sirène Doris class. She was sunk by soviet bombs on 20 August 1944. Her wreck was later raised by the Soviets, repaired and recommissioned as TS-16 but was broken up in December 1946 because of her poor performance","false","false","false","true","false"
